# Scrape my Twitter likes

Scraping my likes from twitter using **Puppeteer** and **NodeJS**.
It will run on a cron job every day and save them in MongoDB so I will be able to index them in ES or Algolia and finally be able to search through them.

🍩Work in progress.

## Run

```sh
npm ci
node index.js
```
